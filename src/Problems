350.Intersection of Two Arrays II - Easy 
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Example:
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
Note:
Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.
Follow up:
What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

83.Remove Duplicates from Sorted List   
Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.
For example,
Given 1->1->2, return 1->2.
Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.

88.Merge Sorted Array   
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
Note:
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.

141. Linked List Cycle I - Easy
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

142.Linked List Cycle II - Easy
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
Note: Do not modify the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?

206.Reverse Linked List - Easy
Reverse a singly linked list.

273.Delete Node in a Linked List - Easy
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.
 
203.Remove Linked List Elements - Easy
Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.
Example
Given: 1 --> 2 --> 6 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6, val = 6
Return: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5

160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists - Easy
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
For example, the following two linked lists:
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
begin to intersect at node c1.
Notes:
If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.


144.Binary Tree Preorder Traversal - Medium   
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},return [1,2,3].

145.Binary Tree Postorder Traversal- Hard
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},return [3,2,1].
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

173.Binary Search Tree Iterator - Medium  
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.
Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
 
274. H-Index - Medium   
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."
For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

211. Add and Search Word - Data structure design - Medium 
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
void addWord(word)
bool search(word)
search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.
For example:
addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true
